      We have discovered that we are not able to host SPAs on Github as you
      cannot directly access a URL from the URL bar, instead the user is
      redirected to Githubâ€™s 404 page. Whilst the direct origin of the error is
      unknown, several other users have encountered the same issue and solved it
      through hosting on a different service provider. Or, when the users go to
      the 404 page, redirect the user back the desirable page.
